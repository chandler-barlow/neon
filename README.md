Neon is an open source social media platform and cryptocurrency running on the Ethereum 2.0 blockchain that provides incentive for answering educational questions with actual money rewards using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) front end and an Amazon Web Services backend.
## How it works
Users can submit questions to the forum for free and anyone can answer. Users can upvote comments and boost questions to extend the post timer.
Advertisers buy our crypto (NEON), which provides cash inflow to the economy. Advertisers can then buy ad time with our coin and users earn coin by wathcing ads, however, it can also be bought.

At the end of the post timer, voting closes and the crypto pot is distributed among the answerers in a proportional way.
